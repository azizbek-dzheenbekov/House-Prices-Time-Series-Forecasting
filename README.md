# House Prices Forecasting

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the use of various forecasting algorithms on the House Prices dataset to predict the prices of managed properties for the next year. The dataset consists of 79 explanatory variables that describe almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The goal is to create a tool that would forecast the price of managed properties for the next year for a property managing company.

## Dataset Description

The House Prices dataset contains 79 explanatory variables describing almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The dataset is available on Kaggle and is used for this project to train and test various forecasting algorithms.

## Technologies Used

This project uses various forecasting algorithms such as linear regression, Random Forest Regressor, Neural Network, ARIMA, and SARIMA. These techniques are implemented using Python libraries such as Scikit-learn, Keras, and Statsmodels.

## Contents

The contents of the notebook are as follows:

1. Loading and preprocessing the dataset
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the dataset
3. Data preparation for forecasting algorithms
4. Forecasting algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Neural Network, ARIMA, SARIMA
5. Evaluation of the forecasting algorithms
6. Conclusion and Future Work

This notebook is suitable for anyone interested in learning about forecasting algorithms and how to apply them to real-world datasets like the House Prices dataset.
